1. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning using neutral networks with multiple layers to 
analyze complex data.  
 
2. Machine learning uses algorithms, while deep learning uses neutral networks with multiple 
layers.  
 
3. A neutral network is computational model inspired by the human brain's structure.  
 
4. Back propagation is an optimization algorithm, adjusting neutral network weights.  
 
5. Activation functions introduce non -linearity, enabling neutral networks to learn co mplex 
patterns.
